Project: IRIS Flower Classification

*Iris flower classification is a common task in machine learning and data analysis, often used as an introductory example for teaching classification algorithms. This task involves identifying the species of Iris flowers based on specific features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

*Iris flower classification is a fundamental example in machine learning that involves predicting flower species based on measurements of sepal and petal dimensions. Utilizing supervised learning techniques, particularly classification algorithms, allows for effective model training and evaluation. The Iris dataset remains a popular choice for beginners to understand interactive data analysis and model development.
